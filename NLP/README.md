# I'm using this repo to store my Natural Language Processing Projects

## Note
Try running this in an isolated environment
If you created an environment called my_env, then from the home folder run
.\my_env\Scripts\activate.bat 
(this only works in Windows)

Alternatively, you can run python -m venv [environment name]
